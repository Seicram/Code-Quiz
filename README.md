# ðŸ”¥ Rapid Fire Quiz Game ðŸ”¥

Rules: This quiz game is a race to answer as many questions as you can correctly before time runs out. Your final score is tallied either when all questions are answered or time runs out. Once you answer a question, right or wrong, a new question will appear. If you answer a question wrong, the time will subtract 10 seconds and display a new question. If your score goes below zero before all questions are answered then the quiz will end. The quiz will end once either all questions have been ansered or the timer runs out.
